# PyTorch Implementation of Optics Simulator and Optimizer (Pytoptics)         
![GitHub Logo]()

It would be appreciated if a reference to the following work, for which this package was originally build, is included whenever this code is used for a publication: (Autors for the moment, a paper is in progres)

Pytoptics (PyTorch Implementation of Optics Simulator and Optimizer) is a python library extended from [KrakenOS](https://github.com/Garchupiter/Kraken-Optical-Simulator/tree/KrakenOS) and based in Pytorch, KrakenOS, Numpy, Matplotlib, PyVTK and PyVista libraries, it provides a three-dimensional optical systems visualization and ray tracing. 

(To-do) In addition to the original utilities in KrakenOS including performing sequential exact ray tracing, generating off-axis systems and calculation of wavefront aberrations in terms of Zernike polynomials, Pytoptics enables users to optimize their optical systems with optimzers.


## install Pytoptics
